# Kindle Notes

Create `flashcards` with Spaced Repetition from your notes. Syncing notes and highlights from `Kindle` books.

You learn many interesting things every day by researching or reading Kindle books but easily forget without revising after some time. This extension allows you to:
- create flashcards in `markdown` format
- sync notes and hightlights from your Kindle and save as flashcards
- revise flashcards

I use this extension daily for my long-term memory. Hope it helps you as well!
