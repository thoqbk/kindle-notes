# Kindle Notes

Create `flashcards` with Spaced Repetition from your notes. Syncing notes and highlights from your `Kindle`.

You learn many interesting things every day by researching or reading books but easily forget if do not revise after some time. This extension allows you to:
- create `flashcards` in `markdown` format
- sync notes and highlights from your `Kindle` and save them as `flashcards`
- revise `flashcards`

I use this extension daily for my `long-term memory`. Hope it helps you as well!
